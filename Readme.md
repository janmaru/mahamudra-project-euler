I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD NOT SHARE OUR SOLUTIONS WITH THE WORLD. INFACT ON THE WEBSITE IT'S WRITTEN...

> I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?
> 
> It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.


BUT THAT'S WHAT I FEEL:

1. sharing knowledge is part of being human (hence the conclusion if you don't do that)
2. the language used is a part of the solution (tho not the important one for the algorithm) so giving out an example can shed some light on the language itself.
3. if you're not really truthful with yourself then nothing can be done about it, for istance you can call a friend or pay someone else to solve your problems, and this would have nothing to do about me publishing an algorithm
4. people who are after badges like lollipops can go fuck themselves
5. the epiphany of discovery is just a dream, as UG Krishnamurti stated once: You're full of greed! Every word you say to me, every question, is an expression of your greed! Whatever it is you want from me, it is greed! I guarantee that you've never had an original thought in your life!
6. sharing your solution on the website (Project Euler website) can be done through messages in the forum area, but messages are deleted on some bases (something like a fifo list unless your message got some kind of non-sense flag) and so even private sharing is not possible.
