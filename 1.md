# Multiples of 3 and 5 #
## Problem 1 ##

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

		//------------ Linear Time Solution: O(n)
		// time execution is directly proportional to the input size

this function yields a list of multiples of 3 and 5:

	//* get all the multiples
	let multiplesOf3And5 n =
	    match n with
	        |n when n<=0 -> []
	        |_-> [for i in 1 .. n-1 do
	                if i%3 = 0 || i%5 = 0 then
	                    yield i
	                else
	                    yield 0]
	               |>List.filter (fun x -> x<>0) 

then we can sum them up:

	//sums the results, including the zeros
	let sumOfMultiplesOf3And5_II n =
	    match n with
	        |n when n<=0 -> 0
	        |_-> [for i in 1 .. n-1 do
	                if i%3 = 0 || i%5 = 0 then
	                    yield i
	                else
	                    yield 0]
	             |> List.sum

the algorithm is O(n), so if you have, let's say 10e12 then you'have to scan all the numbers from 1 to (10e12-1).

Can we do better?

		//------------ <<< O(n)
		// time execution is NOT directly proportional to the input size
We could sum the multiples of 3, the multiples of 5 and then subtract the multiple of 3*5 'cause already counted before:

	//*  sample for 3
	// consider n=mq+r or n = m*3 + (n%3) so m = (n - (n%3))/3
    // is the last factor multiple of 3 before n

	let sumOfmultiplesOfZ n h =
	    let k = n-1 //below n
	    let m = (n - (n%h))/h
	    match k with
	        |k when k<=0 -> 0
	        |_-> [for i in 1 .. m do
	                yield i*h]
	               |>List.sum


		//we have summed numbers divisible by 15 twice ( so we have to subtract them from the sums of the two multiples) once for 3 and then for 5... ie. 30 =3*5*2 as 3*10 and 5*6
		let sumOfMultiplesOf3And5_III n =
		      sumOfmultiplesOfZ n 3 + sumOfmultiplesOfZ n 5 - sumOfmultiplesOfZ n 15
