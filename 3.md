First of all we declare our source number as a mutable variable.
This number can be broken into *aX1*bX2*...fX6* for istance, where X1, X2... etc are prime numbers.
We start from 1 and try to find the first prime number that divides our source. When we find it then we could express the source as X1*otherSource, then we try to find a divider for the otherSource and so on, we stop when the last factor is one.
