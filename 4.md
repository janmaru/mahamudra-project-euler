# Largest palindrome product #
## Problem 4 ##
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


[This problem is part of a project called Project Euler, that you can find here.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4 "project euler")

So what's a palindromic number? How we define it? 
Is it a mathemathical definition or an aestethical one?
If the second answer is true then we're going to use strings and list of chars

		//check if a number is palindromic
		let isPalindromic number=
		    let snumber = number.ToString()
		    let cnumber = [for x in snumber do yield x]
		    //The rev function reverses the elements in a list or array . 
		    let rnumber =  List.rev cnumber
		    if cnumber = rnumber then
		       true
		    else
		       false

Now we start from 9009 and we go ahead counting (adding one)
in order to find other palindromic numbers and we stop 
when k*z = p, where p is the biggest palindromic number with k and z with 3 digits
		 
		let findBiggestPalindromic3 n =
		    let mutable number = n
		    let mutable check = true
		    let mutable counter = 0
		    let mutable isTheNumber = 0
		
		    while check do
		        number<-number+1
		
		        if isPalindromic number then
		           //check the digits
		           for x in 100 .. 999 do
		              if number%x = 0 then
		                 let leny = (number/x).ToString().Length
		                 let lenx = x.ToString().Length
		                 if leny = 3 && lenx = 3 then
		                    isTheNumber <- number
		                 else
		                     if lenx = 3 && leny = 5 then
		                        check<-false
		    
		    isTheNumber
